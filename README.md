# 🏙️ Shortest Path Finder Using Dijkstra & BFS  

## 📌 Overview  
This is a **university project** for implementing **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to determine the **shortest path between two cities**. The program reads the source and destination cities data from a file based on user input, calculates the shortest path, and prints the full route for both algorithms and the total distance (Cost) for **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.  

## 💡 Features  
- **Load Cities:** Reads the file `cities.txt` and constructs a graph representation.  
- **Enter Source City:** Allows the user to input a starting city.  
- **Enter Destination City:** Computes and displays the **shortest path** with distances between cities.  
- **Compare Algorithms:** Prints results for both **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (with total cost) and **BFS**.  
- **Save to File:** Stores the shortest path information in `shortest_distance.txt`.  
- **User-Friendly Menu:** Interactive options for ease of use.  

## ⚙️ How to Use  
**1. Load the city data** from `cities.txt`.   
**2. Enter a source city** to begin searching.   
**3. Enter a destination city** to compute the path.  
**4. View results for both algorithms** and the total shortest cost.

**5. Save results and exit** the program.
